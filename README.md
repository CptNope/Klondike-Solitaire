## Code Description: Klondike Solitaire in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This code is designed to create a playable Klondike Solitaire game directly within a web browser. It utilizes a combination of web technologies to achieve this: HTML for structuring the webpage and its elements, CSS for defining the visual appearance and style of the game, and JavaScript for implementing the core game logic and interactive features.

### HTML Structure (index.html)

The HTML file sets up the fundamental structure of the web page that will host the Solitaire game.

####  `<head>` Section:

This section contains meta-information about the HTML document itself. It specifies the character encoding to ensure proper text display, sets the title that appears in the browser's title bar or tab, and crucially, includes embedded CSS styles.

*   **Character Encoding**:  Ensures the page can display a wide range of characters correctly.
*   **Title**: Defines the title of the webpage, displayed in the browser.
*   **Embedded CSS Styles**:  These styles are defined within `<style>` tags and dictate how various elements of the game will look.  They control aspects like:
    *   The background color of the entire webpage and the game table area.
    *   The font used throughout the game.
    *   Styling for the HTML5 canvas element, which is used for drawing the cards and game elements. This includes setting background color, display properties for centering, and a border.
    *   Styling for a UI overlay, used for elements like buttons. This involves positioning, background with transparency, text color, and button styling (padding, margins, font size, cursor style to indicate interactivity).

#### `<body>` Section:

This section defines the visible content of the webpage, the parts that users will see and interact with.

*   **UI Overlay `<div>`**: This is a container element that holds interactive UI components that are meant to be positioned on top of the game canvas. It contains:
    *   **Restart Game Button**: A button element that, when clicked, is intended to initiate a new game of Solitaire.  Functionality for this button is handled by JavaScript.
    *   **Show Hint Button**: Another button that, when clicked, is designed to provide the player with a game hint.  The hint logic is also implemented in JavaScript.
    *   **Status Message `<div>`**: A text area that displays messages to the user, providing instructions or game status updates.  Initially, it provides basic instructions on how to interact with the game (clicking the stock, dragging cards).

*   **Game Canvas `<canvas>`**:  This is the central element of the game's display. It's an HTML5 canvas element with a specified width and height. The canvas acts as a drawing surface where JavaScript code will dynamically render the card game elements, including cards, piles, and animations.

*   **JavaScript `<script>`**:  This section contains all the JavaScript code that drives the game's behavior. It includes:

### JavaScript Code (within `<script>` tag in HTML):

The JavaScript code is the engine of the Klondike Solitaire game. It is organized into several sections to manage different aspects of the game.

#### 1. Constants and Settings:

This part of the code defines various constant values and settings that are used throughout the game. These include:

*   **Card Dimensions**:  Fixed values for the width and height of the card images that will be drawn on the canvas.
*   **Padding**:  A constant to define the spacing or gap between different card piles on the game layout.
*   **Pile Positions**:  Objects defining the initial coordinates (x and y positions) for different card piles: the stock pile, the waste pile, the four foundation piles, and the starting point for the tableau columns.  It also defines spacing between tableau columns horizontally and vertically.
*   **Card Properties Arrays**:
    *   An array listing all card suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades).
    *   An array listing all card ranks (Ace, 2, 3, ..., Queen, King).
    *   A function `isRed()` that determines if a given card suit is red (Diamonds or Hearts) or black.

#### 2. Game State Variables:

This section declares variables that hold the current state of the game. These variables are updated as the game progresses.

*   **`deck`**:  An array to represent the entire 52-card deck. Initially, it's empty and gets populated when a new game starts.
*   **`stock`**: An array representing the stock pile of cards that the player draws from.
*   **`waste`**: An array for the waste pile, where cards from the stock are moved after being drawn.
*   **`foundations`**: A two-dimensional array representing the four foundation piles. These are where the player aims to build up complete suits in ascending rank order. Each element of the outer array is a foundation pile, which itself is an array holding cards placed there.
*   **`tableau`**:  A two-dimensional array representing the seven tableau columns. These are the main columns of cards on the game layout. Each element of the outer array is a tableau column, and each column is an array holding cards in that column.
*   **`dragState`**: An object used to keep track of the state during card dragging operations. It stores:
    *   `selectedCards`: An array of card objects that are currently being dragged by the player.
    *   `sourcePile`: A reference to the pile (stock, waste, or tableau column) from which the dragged cards originated.
    *   `offsetX`, `offsetY`:  Offsets to calculate the correct position of the dragged cards relative to the mouse cursor.
*   **`canvas`**: A variable that stores a reference to the HTML canvas element in the document, allowing JavaScript to interact with the canvas for drawing.
*   **`ctx`**: A variable to hold the 2D rendering context of the canvas. This context object provides functions for drawing shapes, text, and images onto the canvas.

#### 3. Card Object Definition:

This describes how individual playing cards are represented within the JavaScript code as objects. Each card object has properties like:

*   `suit`: The suit of the card (e.g., "♣", "♦").
*   `rank`: The rank of the card (e.g., "A", "2", ..., "K").
*   `color`:  The color of the card ("red" or "black").
*   `faceUp`: A boolean value indicating whether the card is currently face-up (true) or face-down (false).
*   `drawX`, `drawY`:  These properties are dynamically added to card objects during the drawing process to store the x and y coordinates on the canvas where the card is drawn. This is used for hit detection during mouse clicks.
*   `dragPos`: This property, also dynamically added during dragging, is an object containing `x` and `y` coordinates that track the card's position as it's being dragged by the mouse.

#### 4. Initialization Functions:

These are functions responsible for setting up the game at the start or when restarting.

*   **`initDeck()`**: This function creates a standard 52-card deck. It iterates through all suits and ranks defined in the constants, creating a card object for each combination and adding it to the `deck` array.
*   **`shuffleDeck(array)`**: Implements the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm. This function takes an array (presumably the `deck`) and randomizes the order of elements within it, simulating a real card shuffle.
*   **`deal()`**: This function sets up the initial game layout for Klondike Solitaire. It performs the following actions:
    *   Clears all game state variables (`stock`, `waste`, `foundations`, `tableau`) to start fresh.
    *   Calls `initDeck()` to create a new, full deck of cards.
    *   Calls `shuffleDeck()` to shuffle the newly created deck.
    *   Deals cards to the tableau columns. It deals cards column by column, increasing the number of cards per column from 1 to 7. In each column, all cards except the top one are dealt face-down.
    *   Places the remaining cards from the deck into the `stock` pile, all face-down.

#### 5. Drawing Functions:

These functions handle the visual rendering of the game on the canvas.

*   **`drawCard(card, x, y)`**: This function is responsible for drawing a single card at a specified position (`x`, `y`) on the canvas. It takes a card object and coordinates as input.
    *   It handles drawing both face-up and face-down cards.
    *   For face-up cards, it draws a white rectangle with a black border, and then draws the card's rank and suit in the appropriate color (red or black).
    *   For face-down cards, it draws a blue rectangle with a black border and a white checkerboard pattern to represent the card back.
*   **`drawGame()`**: This function orchestrates the drawing of the entire game scene on the canvas. It is called to refresh the display.
    *   Clears the entire canvas to prepare for redrawing.
    *   Draws the stock pile. If there are cards in the stock, it draws a face-down card back; otherwise, it draws an empty rectangle outline to represent an empty stock.
    *   Draws the waste pile. If there are cards in the waste, it draws the top card face-up; otherwise, it draws an empty rectangle outline.
    *   Draws the four foundation piles. For each foundation, if there are cards, it draws the top card face-up; otherwise, it draws an empty rectangle outline.
    *   Iterates through the seven tableau columns. For each card in each column, it calculates the drawing position based on the column index and card index within the column, and calls `drawCard()` to draw each card. It skips drawing cards that are currently being dragged and records the `drawX` and `drawY` positions on each card object for later use in hit detection.
    *   Finally, it draws any cards that are currently being dragged (stored in `dragState.selectedCards`). These are drawn on top of all other game elements at their `dragPos` coordinates, if defined.

#### 6. Drag and Drop Handling:

This section includes functions and event listeners that manage user interaction with the game through mouse events, specifically for dragging and dropping cards.

*   **`getMousePos(evt)`**:  This helper function takes a mouse event object as input and calculates the mouse cursor's position relative to the top-left corner of the canvas element.
*   **`getCardIndexInPile(pile, x, y)`**: This function determines if a mouse click at coordinates (`x`, `y`) intersects with any card in a given card `pile` (tableau column, waste, etc.). It iterates through the cards in the pile (from top to bottom) and checks if the click coordinates fall within the drawn area of each card. It returns the index of the clicked card within the pile or -1 if no card is clicked.
*   **`canvas.addEventListener("mousedown", function(evt) { ... })`**: This sets up an event listener for mouse button press events on the canvas. When a mouse button is pressed down on the canvas, this function is executed.
    *   It first gets the mouse coordinates using `getMousePos()`.
    *   It checks if the click is within the bounds of the stock pile area. If so, it calls `handleStockClick()` to deal with stock pile interaction.
    *   If not a stock click, it checks if the click is on the waste pile (only the top card is considered clickable in the waste). If clicked on the waste, it initiates the card dragging process for the top card of the waste pile.
    *   If not a stock or waste click, it iterates through the tableau columns to check if a card in any tableau column was clicked.  It uses `getCardIndexInPile()` to find the clicked card within a tableau column. If a face-up card in the tableau is clicked, it initiates dragging of that card and all cards below it in that column (forming a substack).
    *   When dragging starts (for waste or tableau cards), it sets up the `dragState` object: it stores the `selectedCards` (the card or substack being dragged), the `sourcePile` (the pile the cards came from), and calculates `offsetX` and `offsetY` to ensure the card is dragged smoothly from where the user clicked.
*   **`canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", function(evt) { ... })`**: This event listener is for mouse movement events while the mouse button is held down and moved on the canvas.
    *   It checks if `dragState.selectedCards` is currently active (meaning a drag operation is in progress).
    *   If dragging is active, it gets the current mouse position using `getMousePos()`.
    *   It then updates the `dragPos` property for each card in the `dragState.selectedCards`. The `dragPos` is calculated based on the current mouse position and the `offsetX` and `offsetY` that were set during the `mousedown` event, ensuring that the cards move smoothly under the mouse cursor, and are stacked correctly during dragging.
    *   After updating drag positions, it calls `drawGame()` to redraw the canvas, showing the cards moving in real-time as the mouse moves.
*   **`canvas.addEventListener("mouseup", function(evt) { ... })`**: This event listener is triggered when the mouse button is released after being pressed down on the canvas.
    *   It checks if `dragState.selectedCards` is active (meaning a drag operation was in progress).
    *   If a drag was in progress, it gets the final mouse position when the button is released.
    *   It then checks if the dragged cards are being dropped onto a valid target location:
        *   It iterates through the tableau columns to see if the drop location is over a tableau column and if the move is a valid tableau move according to the game rules (using `isValidTableauMove()`). If it's a valid tableau move, it calls `moveSubstack()` to move the cards from their source pile to the target tableau column and sets a `moveMade` flag to true.
        *   If not dropped onto a valid tableau column, it checks if it's a single-card move to a foundation pile. It iterates through the foundation piles to see if the drop location is over a foundation pile and if the move is valid according to foundation rules (using `isValidFoundationMove()`). If it's a valid foundation move, it calls `moveCardToFoundation()` to move the card to the foundation and sets `moveMade` to true.
    *   If no valid move was made (i.e., `moveMade` is still false after checking tableau and foundations), it means the drop was invalid. In this case, it removes the `dragPos` property from each of the dragged cards. This has the effect of causing the cards to "snap back" to their original positions when the game is next redrawn.
    *   Clears `dragState.selectedCards` and `dragState.sourcePile` to reset the drag state, indicating that dragging is no longer in progress.
    *   Calls `autoFlipTopCards()` to automatically flip face-down cards that become the top card of a tableau column after a move.
    *   Finally, it calls `drawGame()` to redraw the game board with the cards in their new positions (or snapped back to original positions if the move was invalid).

#### 7. Move and Validation Functions:

These functions implement the game rules for validating card moves and for actually moving cards between piles.

*   **`isValidTableauMove(movingCards, targetPile)`**: This function checks if a move of `movingCards` (a substack) to a `targetPile` (a tableau column) is valid according to Klondike Solitaire rules.
    *   If the `targetPile` is empty, it checks if the moving card is a King (only Kings can be moved to empty tableau columns).
    *   If the `targetPile` is not empty, it checks if the bottom card of the `movingCards` substack is one rank lower and of the opposite color to the top card of the `targetPile`.
*   **`isValidFoundationMove(card, foundationPile)`**: This function checks if moving a single `card` to a `foundationPile` is a valid move.
    *   If the `foundationPile` is empty, it checks if the card is an Ace (only Aces can start foundation piles).
    *   If the `foundationPile` is not empty, it checks if the `card` is of the same suit and one rank higher than the top card of the `foundationPile`.
*   **`moveSubstack(movingCards, sourcePile, targetPile)`**: This function performs the action of moving a substack of cards from a source pile to a target tableau pile. It finds the starting card of the `movingCards` within the `sourcePile`, removes the substack from the `sourcePile`, and then appends the substack to the `targetPile`.
*   **`moveCardToFoundation(card, sourcePile, foundationPile)`**: This function moves a single `card` from a `sourcePile` to a `foundationPile`. It finds the index of the `card` in the `sourcePile`, removes it from the source, and adds it to the `foundationPile`.
*   **`autoFlipTopCards()`**: This function is called after a card move to automatically reveal any face-down cards that are now at the top of a tableau column. It iterates through each tableau column, and if a column is not empty and its top card is face-down, it flips that card face-up.

#### 8. Stock Handling Function:

*   **`handleStockClick()`**: This function manages what happens when the player clicks on the stock pile area.
    *   If the `stock` pile is not empty, it takes the top card from the `stock`, flips it face-up, and moves it to the `waste` pile. This simulates drawing a card from the stock.
    *   If the `stock` pile is empty, it recycles the `waste` pile back into the `stock`. It takes all cards from the `waste` pile, flips them face-down, and moves them back to the `stock` pile. This effectively resets the stock pile using the waste pile.

#### 9. Game Loop:

*   **`gameLoop()`**: This function is the heart of the game's animation and continuous update process. It's designed to be called repeatedly to create a smooth animation effect.
    *   It calls `drawGame()` in each iteration to redraw the entire game board.
    *   It uses `requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop)` to schedule the next execution of the `gameLoop` function. `requestAnimationFrame` is a browser API that optimizes animations and ensures smooth rendering by synchronizing animation frames with the browser's refresh rate.

#### 10. UI and Debug Controls:

This section sets up event listeners for UI elements and includes a simple hint function.

*   **Event Listeners for Buttons**:
    *   An event listener is attached to the "Restart Game" button. When this button is clicked, it calls the `deal()` function to reset the game and `drawGame()` to update the display to reflect the new game state.
    *   An event listener is attached to the "Show Hint" button. Clicking this button calls the `getHint()` function to attempt to find a valid move and display it to the player using an alert box.
*   **`getHint()`**: This function provides a basic game hint to the player. It's a relatively simple hint system that checks for possible moves in a specific order:
    *   First, it checks if the top card of the waste pile can be moved to any of the foundation piles. If it finds such a move, it returns a hint message suggesting this move.
    *   If no waste-to-foundation move is found, it then checks for tableau-to-tableau moves. It iterates through each tableau column and, for the top card of each column, checks if it can be moved to any other tableau column. If it finds a valid tableau move, it returns a hint suggesting this move.
    *   If no valid moves are found in either of these checks, it returns `null`, indicating that no hint is available (or that no moves are currently possible).

#### 11. Game Start:

This is the final section that initiates the game when the script is loaded.

*   **`deal()`**: The `deal()` function is called to set up the initial game state and deal the cards.
*   **`gameLoop()`**:  The `gameLoop()` function is called to start the game loop, which begins the continuous redrawing of the game canvas and thus starts the game's animation and interactivity.

### Summary:

In essence, this code creates a fully interactive Klondike Solitaire game in the browser. It uses HTML to structure the page, CSS to style its appearance, and JavaScript to handle all game logic, card drawing, drag and drop interactions, move validation, and the overall game flow. The code is modular, with functions dedicated to specific tasks like dealing, drawing, handling moves, and providing hints, making it reasonably organized and understandable.
